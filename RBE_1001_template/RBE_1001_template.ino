/* This is the RBE 1001 Template as of 2/26/2015. This Template 
 is designed to run the autonomous and teleop sections of the final 
 competition. Write and test your autonomous and teleop code on your
 own, then simply copy and paste your code into the appropriate section 
 and make sure the time passed to each function corresponds with the
 time in seconds that each set of code should run. For example,
 autonomous(20); will run for 20 seconds after the transmitter is 
 turned on. The code will not start until the controller is turned on.
 There are print statements commented out that were used to test */
